Title: Code formatting

In this task you need to use linters and autoformatters.

Task1: Take the code from lab 9 (with splitted modules) and analyze the code using flake8
    (or other linter, but *NOT* PyCharm default). Take the screenshot of warnings detected be flake8 and
    resolve them on your own without usage of autoformatters.

Task2: Take the code from lab 10 and format it using black (or other autoformatter, but *NOT* PyCharm default).
